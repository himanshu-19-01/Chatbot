        "Your credit score gets affected by the below-mentioned factors :- a) Your payment history - Payment history defines how consistently you have made your payments on time. This is the most important contributor to your credit score. b) Credit utilization ratio - Your credit utilization is the second most important contributor to your credit score. Using more than 30% of your available credit is a negative to the creditors. c) Tenure of credit history - Tenure of credit history simply means for how long you have held the credit accounts. Generally, the older your credit account, the higher your credit score. d.New credit account - The number of credit accounts you have recently opened, as well as the number of hard inquiries lenders make when you apply for credit affects your credit score. Too many accounts or inquiries reflects an increase in risk which may hurt your credit score. e)Credit mix - Your score can increase if you responsibly use different types of credit, such as installment and revolving debt. Even so, it's not necessary to have many different types of credit in order to have a good score. "
